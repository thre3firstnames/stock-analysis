# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
Summarize the performance of 12 stocks over the course of two separate years, refactoring an existing VBA module to perform this task more quickly and efficiently than its predecessor. 

## Results
### Stock Performance 2017 & 2018

Based on performance, all stocks included in this dataset grew in 2017, with _TERP_ as the exception. _TERP_ underperformed during both years, and I cannot recommend investment based on the available data. 

While _DQ_ was the high-performing victor in 2017, its loss in 2018 also makes it an unwise investment. 





### Execution Times & Code Analysis
*(Using images and examples of your code:
1. compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018
2. and the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.)*

###Summary
*( In a summary statement, address the following questions.
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?)*
