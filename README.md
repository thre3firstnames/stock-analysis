# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
Summarize the performance of 12 stocks over two different years, refactoring an existing VBA module to perform this task more quickly and efficiently than its predecessor. 

## Results
### Stock Performance 2017 & 2018

Based on performance, all stocks included in this dataset grew in 2017, with **TERP** as the exception. **TERP** underperformed during both years, and I cannot recommend investment based on the available data. Conversely, for most of these stocks, 2018 was a poor year except for **ENPH** and **RUN**. 

While **DQ** was the high-performing victor in 2017, its loss in 2018 also makes it an unwise investment. As discovered earlier, Steve should advise his parents to invest in a different stock. My recommendation based on this scope would be **ENPH** as it finished each year strong and outpaced its competitors. If theyâ€™re looking to diversify, **RUN** would be a great second choice, as its growth over 2018 suggests an upward trend. 

### Execution Times & Code Analysis
#### Original VBA Execution Times

In this incarnation of the code, I used the ```tickers``` array within a nested ```For``` loop and forced the code to look at every line of the dataset each time a new ticker was referenced. This made the program unnecessarily cumbersome, hence the longer execution times pictured above. 

```
    For i = 0 To 11
        
        ticker = tickers(i)
        totalVolume = 0
        
        Worksheets(yearValue).Activate
        
        For j = 2 To RowCount
         
            If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
        
                totalVolume = totalVolume + Cells(j, 8).Value
        
            End If
            
            If Cells(j - 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
        
                startingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
        
            End If
        
            If Cells(j + 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
        
                endingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
        
            End If
        Next j
```

#### Refactored VBA Execution Times

In the refactored code, I created an index of ```tickers``` which allowed each ticker to be used in the searching of the data but included code to advance the index every time a different ticker value was reached. Using this method, and by assigning values to each of the output arrays, the program looped over the dataset only once, saving time and making the program much cleaner. 

```
    For i = tickerIndex To 11

        tickerVolumes(i) = 0
    
    Next i

    For i = 2 To RowCount

        tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
       
        If Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
        
            tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
        
         End If

        If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
        
            tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
            
            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
             
        End If

    Next i
    
    For i = 0 To 11
    
     Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
            Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = tickers(i)
            Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = tickerVolumes(i)
            Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = tickerEndingPrices(i) / tickerStartingPrices(i) - 1
    Next i
```



###Summary
*( In a summary statement, address the following questions.
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?)*
